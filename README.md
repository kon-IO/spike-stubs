# Stubs for common Lego SPIKE Prime Python modules

This project contains the documentation that is offered in the SPIKE App in stub files.

The purpose of this project is to enable you to use your favorite code editor with code suggestions to write code for the SPIKE Prime Hub.

## Usage
There are 2 main ways to make the stub files visible to your editor's code suggestion feature:
1. Add the 'spike' directory to the same directory as the code file you're editing. If this works, this is the recommended way to do it, as you won't modify your installation.
2. If the previous way doesn't work, the next thing to do would be to place the 'spike' directory into the 'Lib' directory of your Python installation. This will make it seem like the spike library has been installed by default. It is a bit nasty, but it is more likely to work than the previous way if your editor is not that 'smart'. *(You may also need to restart your editor)*
